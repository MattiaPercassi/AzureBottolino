Hi, my name is Bottolino!
I will help you keep track of your expanses in few simple steps.
You can make a request through the menu commands, and I will guide you from there.
Use /insert to start recording a transaction.
Use /updateemail to let me know where to mail the compiled reports.
You can interrupt a request at any stage by using /delete.
